        <h2>Purpose of the assignment</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="text-justify">Blogging is one of the fundamental social media practices arguably the first widespread form of social media. Blogging is one important way in which people take part in conversations within their area of interest, establish their expertise, and construct an online identity. The blogosphere is a place where communities form, grow, change, and dissolve.</p>
         
        <p class="text-justify">The purpose of this assignment is twofold: first, to ensure that students gain familiarity with blogging as a practice, and second, to offer another venue for discussion of class topics. Students will contribute original posts and comment on classmates’ posts over the course of several weeks.</p>

       <h3 style='text-align: left;' >Details</h3>

        <p class="text-justify">Students  must create create an account at Tumblr, and let the TA know your Tumblr ID or URL. As for the Twitter assignment, you may use a pseudonym and limited bio information to protect your privacy if you wish, but I must be informed of your ID so I can grade your assignment. If students already have a Tumblr account, they may either use it here or create  a new account specifically for this class. Email your Tumblr ID to the TA.</p>
       

        <p class="text-justify">You must post at least four times during the assignment period. You may not post (for credit) more than once in a single week, so make sure to budget your time appropriately.</p>
       

        <p class="text-justify">After spending so much of my career focused on Apple, I possess both an insider’s and an outsider’s view of what’s happening with the watch, and there are several things I’d love to see developed (or at least considered). Here are a few areas in which future iterations of the Apple Watch could be improved to help reach (and boost) projected sales.</p>
             
        <p class="text-justify">Fashion: The current Apple Watch is sleek and smooth compared with other smartwatches, but even as a tech device, it could push the style envelope further. Fashion industry executives now at Apple, including those from brands such as Yves Saint Laurent and Burberry, have tried to establish Apple as a lifestyle brand by upping its sex appeal. The company is even partnering with fashion designer Hermès.</p>
      
        <p class="text-justify">Although Apple has been successful in these ventures for the most part, the exclusive styles born out of these collaborations are still too expensive for most buyers. Everyone wants to be able to customize her watchbands, not just those with deep pockets.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">Apple’s next step, then, should be partnering with more inexpensive brands like Target to increase customizability while decreasing the watch’s price. By doing so, Apple would optimize its product by appealing to more of the masses.</p>
